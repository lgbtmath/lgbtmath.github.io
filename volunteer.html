        <h1>Get Involved!</h1>
    </header>
    <p>In order to better serve and support the LGBTQ+ math community, the board has been
working hard to reorganize and formalize various parts of Spectra. While this is a large and
ongoing project, we are excited to announce the formation of a number of new
committees! In codifying these changes we hope to create new and easier ways for
individuals to become involved with and shape the future of Spectra. <br /><br />
    
If you are interested in joining any of the committees described below please feel free to reach out to the appropriate committee chair or complete this <a href="https://forms.gle/52cZxkAw47AvBfk97">Volunteer Form</a></p>

        	<h1>Membership Committee</h1>
        	<h2>Chair: Stephan Patterson</h2>
        	<h2>Email: membership at lgbtmath.org</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            This committee promotes community among LGBTQ+ mathematicians. This group oversees the Out and Ally Lists, as well as promoting and supporting the Student Chapters.

        	<h1>Profession Committee</h1>

        </header>
        <p>
            The main charge of Spectra’s
Profession Committee is to support the professional development of LGBTQ+
mathematicians and our inclusion in the larger community of professional
mathematicians. In the past, this has fallen into two big categories: facilitating
workshops and panel discussions at the JMM, and organizing conferences for
LGBTQ+ mathematicians. If you have interest or experience in planning or running
these kinds of activities or have ideas for other ways to support the professional
development of LGBTQ+ math folks, please consider self-nominating for the
Profession Committee.

        	<h1>Outreach &amp; Development Committee</h1>
        	<h2>Chair: AJ Fong</h2>
          <h2>Email: outreach at lgbtmath.org</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            The focus of Spectra’s Outreach and Communications Committee is keeping LGBTQ+
mathematicians updated about any events and initiatives that can help further
inclusive spaces in mathematics. This can entail overseeing Spectra’s online
presence on social media, creating campaigns to increase the visibility of LGBTQ+
mathematicians, developing the newsletter to keep members informed about what’s
happening in the LGBTQ+ Math and STEM community, and through other events
and activities to engage a wide swatch of the mathematics community. We are
looking for community members that are willing to work together to brainstorm
new outreach initiatives, as well as further the scope of this newsletter.

        	<h2>Chair: Alex Hoover</h2>
          <h2>Email: advocacy at lgbtmath.org</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            This committee advocates for a more just and inclusive community for LGBTQ+ matheamticians. Tasks include tracking potential issues and working with partners to best support.

            <h1>Equity, Diversity, Inclusion, and Accessibility (EDIA) Committee</h1>
            <h2>Chair: Alex Wiedemann</h2>
            <h2>Email: edia at lgbtmath.org</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
            Recognizing the importance of intersectionality, the focus of the EDI committee is
to help support mathematicians along all axes of identity. A primary focus of this committee is interfacing with other affinity-based organizations. The EDI committee will be involved in many of the projects listed
in the other committee descriptions, providing meaningful feedback to ensure
Spectra is always striving to act more justly and improve its impact. Please consider
self-nominating for this committee if you have experience or interest in this
continued work.

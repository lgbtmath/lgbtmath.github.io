			Spectra is delight to support students wanting to form Spectra Student Chapters at their home institutions. The set-up is pretty simple, and it is outlined in the <a href="StudentChapters/Welcome_Document.pdf">Welcome Document</a>.  If you have any questions, please reach out to the Membership Chair.
		</p>

			<h1>Forming Student Chapters</h1>
		</header>
		<p>
			To form a Spectra chapter, you will need to send the Membership Chair two things:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>please fill out the <a href="StudentChapters/Application_Form.pdf">Application Form</a>.</li>
			<li>You will need to craft and include with your application your proposed bylaws; here is a <a href="StudentChapters/Spectra_Chapter_Bylaws_Template.docx">bylaws template</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			After receipt of your application materials, the Membership Chair will bring your application to the next Board Meeting. You should hear shortly thereafter! There is no cost associated with forming or maintaining a Spectra student chapter.<br /><br />
			If you need to update your bylaws, change officers or faculty advisor, or dissolve your chapter, please fill out the <a href="StudentChapters/Update_Form.pdf">Update Form</a>.

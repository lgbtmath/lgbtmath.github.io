                        Hannah Housden is currently a Senior Lecturer at Vanderbilt University, where she was previously a postdoc. She earned her PhD in Math from UCLA in 2022, and her research is in algebraic topology and category theory. Her teaching focuses on empowering students to be agents in their own mathematical education and to see themselves as part of the mathematical community. She invites her students to be critical of math (i.e. "how can this be useful in my real life?") rather than have math be critical of them (i.e. "how can I make sure I pass this test?").

                        State University Shreveport. He is an applied

                        of mathematics, which thus far has included tools from
                        optimization, data science, statistics, computer
                        science, graph theory, and numerical analysis. They
                        completed a Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics at the
                        University of Colorado Denver in 2020; more recently,
                        they have co-authored two OER textbooks. When not at
                        school, he can be found playing with his young son,
                        experimenting in the kitchen, or with his head in a

                        Computer Science at Randolph-Macon College. My main
                        areas of interest are operator theory, mathematical
                        physics, and (spectral) graph theory. I am especially
                        interested in interdisciplinary questions which use
                        tools from these fields in unexpected ways. More
                        broadly, I seek to understand the interplay between
                        continuous and discrete structures. I am also interested
                        in the roles of diversity and inclusivity mathematics,
                        and in the development of teaching practices which
                        better serve students from historically underrepresented
                        groups.

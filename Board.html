        Hello, I'm Alex Hoover, an assistant professor in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Akron. I'm an applied mathematician whose research is at the intersection computational mathematics, fluid dynamics, and mathematical biology. Originally from the northeast Ohio, I got my PhD at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. After that, I spent three years in lovely New Orleans for a postdoc at Tulane University before heading up north to Akron. I am firmly invested in increasing the visibility of LGBTQ+ mathematicians and creating a safe productive space for all of my students to thrive.

    <p>Hi, I’m <a href="https://www.alexwiedemann.online/">Alex Wiedemann</a>, a Visiting Assistant Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science at Randolph-Macon College. My main areas of interest are operator theory, mathematical physics, and (spectral) graph theory. I am especially interested in interdisciplinary questions which use tools from these fields in unexpected ways. More broadly, I seek to understand the interplay between continuous and discrete structures. I am also interested in the roles of diversity and inclusivity mathematics, and in the development of teaching practices which better serve students from historically underrepresented groups.</p>
